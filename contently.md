	<p>Contently is the anti-content farm, a platform where real journalists can manage their freelance careers, and where brands-turned-publishers can create and manage editorial operations.  They were part of the TechStars NYC Summer program and I had the opportunity to work with this amazing team.</p>
	<h1 class="category grey clear">Premium Profile Design</h1>
	<p>Contently wants to build premium profile designs for their journalists to showcase their work.  They requested a unique design.  I took my inspiration from isotope.js and came up with the following design.  Based on the popularity of the article, it would receive a larger bounding box.</p>

	<img src="../../img/gallery/contently/contently-1.jpg" class="append-bottom" caption="final layout">
	
	<h1 class="category grey clear">Icon Design</h1>
	<p>Contently wanted an icon for their Twitter feed, so I tried my hand at visual.  I drew some initial sketches before we decided on an iOS style keyboard using the letter C.  A few iterations, et voila.  I wanted to maintain the Contently blue and I was playing with the angle a bit before they decided on the lower right view.</p>
