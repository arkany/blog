    label: Photo Chat marketing page
    description: This was a marketing piece for a photo-chatting app. When their competition closed up shop, we conceived of a marketing landing page to help people move from onto their product. It was ultimately not used, but it was an early foray into skeumorphic design. There are pieces I am especially proud of, such as the camera lens. Piictu is now working on something new - be sure to keep an eye out.

    description: The Rig is a delightful horror film, directed by Peter Atencio. During post-production, I was hired to work on poster concepts. Ultimately, they went with a different poster, but I was rather proud of this design. If you are into creature features, you should totally check it out!
