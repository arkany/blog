    label: Snapscouts
    description: SnapScouts is agitprop software theatre. SnapScouts received over 80,000 hits was mentioned in several blogs including Wired, LA Times, Reddit and Download Squad. The Android application and accompanying site lets you download the app to your Android phone. The app ultimately promotes kids spying on your neighborhood and parents. This is, of course, a terrible idea, but by creating awareness, it will hopefully promote privacy.

    label: Pystache Logo
    description: Pystache is an open source project, specifically a Python implementation of the Mustache templating system. I respect the project, especially because the mascot simply had to be a python with a mustache. I designed the logo on spec and then pushed it to the Github account. I was fortunate enough to be approved. Technically it is a WIP. I plan to add better details to the back and modify some details.

    label: MobIntent Logo
    description: MobIntent is a platform to run optimized mobile advertising campaigns. They needed a new logo to showcase their new brand. I designed the logo and gave an overview on how to best present their brand. Given the impressive qualities of their advertising platform, it felt like the &quot;James Bond&quot; of advertising platforms. Classy, sharp, a scalpel into the current mobile ad landscape. I believe their colors should match luxury brands and cars and designed their logo thusly.

    label: Photo Chat marketing page
    description: This was a marketing piece for a photo-chatting app. When their competition closed up shop, we conceived of a marketing landing page to help people move from onto their product. It was ultimately not used, but it was an early foray into skeumorphic design. There are pieces I am especially proud of, such as the camera lens. Piictu is now working on something new - be sure to keep an eye out.

    label: The Rig - Concept Poster
    description: The Rig is a delightful horror film, directed by Peter Atencio. During post-production, I was hired to work on poster concepts. Ultimately, they went with a different poster, but I was rather proud of this design. If you are into creature features, you should totally check it out!

    label: WearWhere
    description: An agitprop mobile web app where people could select from their favorite brands, only to discover the horrible working conditions of the workers of their favorite clothes. The hope is people who used the app would reconsider the value of their clothes if they knew the people making the shirts cannot afford the very shirts they make.

    label: Ordr.in - Facebook Mockup
    description: Ordr.in is a food ordering API that was part of the TechStars 2011 Summer Program. They needed a white-label Facebook application to give to their delivery partners throughout the US. I was brought in to brainstorm on the timeline of the product, then build out the vision, UI/UX, and finally the visual design. When we showed it to Facebook, they said it was, &quot;One of the best uses of the platform for commerce we've ever seen.&quot;
