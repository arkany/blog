![Hello image](/img/header2.jpg)

Hello and welcome / welcome back!  This site was in need of an overhaul after my intial 'oh god oh god, I need a job!' days.  I will update the blog weekly, in the coming months.  I'll cover my work as a writer, as well as a technologist.

## And I have what to look forward to...

Hey man, I don't know! I haven't written it yet! But the goal here is

* Personal Reviews
* Photos
* High Fructose Zombies Updates
* Portfolio Refresh
* Random Insights

The goal here is not to have the end all be all of blogs. I really just wanted a flexible site to try stuff, talk about things when I need and even learn a little bit. I was tired of saying "I really should update my portfolio." 

For those curious, the site is built on Jekyll, and quite the heavy dose of jquery, SCSS and such. At the moment of this writing, I'm wholesaling a demo from codrops for the portfolio; they do great work and I've wanted to use their work for some time. 

Thank you so much for reading and I'll see you next week!
