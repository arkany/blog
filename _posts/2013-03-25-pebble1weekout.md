title: Pebble - 2 Weeks In

I got my Pebble about two weeks ago and while there has been a lot of great blogs about Pebble thus far (see XXX, YYY, and ZZZ), I just wanted to throw in 3 perspectives here that I haven't seen anywhere else.

First things first: 

##Watch Design from an Accessories Designer

My wife used to be an Accessories Designer at a company that made watches and belts, among other things.  Maybe it's cuz she's my wife and I think she's brilliant, but she made some awesome points

* **A Man's Watch** - Immediately after she put it on, she said, "Well, this is clearly made for a man." The average wrist size of a woman is XXX, but the watch is XXX.  A more unisex style would be the XXX, for comparison.

* **Wriststrap Trending** - I saw a few complaints on the web regarding the wriststrap looking ugly, but the material they used was apparently rather trendy.  

* **Big Ol Buttons** - The buttons seemed rather large, when in comparison to an iPod Nano for example, but that's entirely due to the expense.  Smaller buttons that still work effectively would require a mold from steel rather than rubber, which is a difference of tens of thousands of dollars.
