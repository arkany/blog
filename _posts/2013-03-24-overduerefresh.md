title: The Much Needed Overhaul
layout: post

Hello and welcome / welcome back!  This site was in need of an overhaul after my intial oh god oh god, I need a portfolio days.  This will be hopefully updated at least monthly, if not more for the coming months.

## And I have what to look forward to...

So very glad you asked.

* Pebble Review
* High Fructose Zombie Updates
* Portfolio Refresh
* Random Insights

The goal here is not to have the end all be all of blogs. I really just wanted a flexible site to try stuff, talk about things when I need and even learn a little bit. I was tired of saying "I really should update my portfolio." 

For those curious, the site is built on Jekyll, and quite the heavy dose of jquery, SCSS and such. At the moment of this writing, I outright took the demo from codrops for the portfolio; they do incredible work and I've wanted to snag something of theirs for some time. 

Thank you so much for reading this far!
