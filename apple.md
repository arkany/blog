<h2>Apple - Mobile Me Internship</h2>
				
<p>I worked at Apple for the summer with the MobileMe Design team as an Interaction / Product Designer. This is where I mastered the art of Keynote.  It was an incredible experience to work with people at the top of their game.  I would like to thank Apple for welcoming me into their family for three months.</p>

<p>This is the total sum of work I can show from my internship.</p>
