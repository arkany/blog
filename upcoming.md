<h2>Site Design</h2>
<p>I was hired by a starup to come up with a quick redesign of their site. One of the key strengths of the startup are the increases in user engagement. I was asked to begin with the landing page, so that's as far as the site was designed.</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Lead Designer</li>
</ul>
The iteration process was exaustive, but once we came upon the polygon chart, we hit a design we liked.
<ul class="row">
	<img src="{{:root}}/img/gallery/portfolio/upcoming-1.jpg" class="large-6 columns">
	<img src="{{:root}}/img/gallery/portfolio/upcoming-2.jpg" class="large-6 columns">	
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Ultimately, the company chose not to use the design, but I rather like it.  If you wish to use this design, please let me know. </p>
