<h2 id="bookbridge-main" class="title-img">BookBridge</h2>
<p>BookBridge is my thesis project the ITP Master's Program at NYU.  It is the end product of my research into the digital transition for literature. I investigated the current state of digital books through interviews and research, exposing their benefits and limitations. I examined the problems libraries face including budget cuts, fair use, and digital rights management. Several existing book sharing communities are explored, both legal and illegal. I built my prototype, which can be found at <a href="http://bookbridge.me/">bookbridge.me</a>, to test my thesis and offered around 100 books to users for testing and analysis.</p>
