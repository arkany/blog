<p><a href="https://github.com/defunkt/pystache">Pystache</a> is a Python implementation of the Mustache templating system.  I respect the project, especially because the mascot simply had to be a python with a mustache.  I designed the logo on spec and then pushed it to the Github account.  I was fortunate enough to be approved.  Technically it is a WIP. I plan to add better details to the back and modify some details.</p>
