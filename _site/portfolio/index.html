Given the impressive qualities of their advertising platform, it felt like the &quot;James Bond&quot; of advertising platforms. Classy, sharp, a scalpel into the current mobile ad landscape. I believe their colors should match luxury brands and cars and designed their logo thusly."><img src="../img/gallery/thumbs/mobintent.jpg" alt="img01"/>

Piictu is now working on something new - be sure to keep an eye out."><img src="../img/gallery/thumbs/piictu.jpg" alt="img01"/>
