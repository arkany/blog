		<h1>Comic Book Startup</h1>
		<p class="date">July 17, 2013</p>
	  <p><img src="/img/cb-startup.jpg" alt="High Fructose Zombies" /></p>

<p>As you may or may not know, my wife and I are the co-creators of the comic book <a href="http://highfructosezombies.com/">High Fructose Zombies</a>.  I was also a Hackstar at <a href="http://techstars.com/">TechStars</a> for their NYC Summer 2011 team.  So, when we created HFZ, we did our best to implement a quick, iterative build process in the same way I use agile development at work.  "F#$% it. Ship it." as the kids say.  I think the cat is out of the bag that most creative works are not perfect on the first go around.</p>

<p>This is the first of the Iterative Comic Design posts on how to not let 'getting it right' get in the way of 'getting it done.'</p>

<h2>Know your Fudging Audience</h2>

<p>When I wrote the first issue of HFZ, my audience was very clear: me.  Generally, culturally aware folks ages 23-42, hopefully clever and smart, fun, fine with swear words, blood and guts.  It is a zombie comic, right? Blood and guts are part of the minimum viable product, really.</p>

<p>But when we premiered our first issue at <a href="http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/">NYCC</a>, however, Sarah and I quickly realized that a large unforseen demographic interested in HFZ were girls, ages 9-13.  In hindsight, that makes perfect sense: we have a cool looking female lead character, Clea, and we have candy EVERYWHERE.  Of course kids like it!  Swear words were limiting our potential user base.</p>

<p><img src="/img/cb-startup-2.jpg" alt="the smarter fudging plan" /></p>

<p>It was always our intention to treat the NYCC launch as a beta test and, by the very nature of print runs, we limited the release. It's true, we get to cheat. We were able to see the user reaction in one giant weekend, rather than waiting to find usable data points from a limited base. In our post-mortem, we opted to convert all swear words to a candy-based cursing communique("Fudge this! For crepes sake! Gumballs.")  Now when we have concerned parents who ask about language, we state with confidence that it's AOK.  The candy swearing is a stronger choice, better for world building and adults know what we're saying, but we never would have realized that without having that initial beta release.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
