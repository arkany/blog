<h2>WearWhere</h2>
<p>WearWhere is an slightly twisted iPhone web application for teens to find out where there clothes came from.  The kids lose points for buying clothes from brands who exploit their workers, and they can win those points back by writing their Senator, signing petitions, sharing the truth on Twitter and pledging to never buy those clothes again.</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keynote Prototyper</li>
	<li>Lead Designer</li>
